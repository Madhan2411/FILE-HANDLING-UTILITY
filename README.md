# 📂 **File Handling Utility in Java**

This project is part of my internship task and demonstrates basic **file handling operations in Java**, including reading, writing, and modifying files. 

## **Project Overview**

The **File Handling Utility** is a Java-based program designed to perform three core operations on text files:

### **1. Write to a File**

Creates a new file and writes initial content to it.

### **2. Read from a File**

Reads and displays the file content line by line.

### **3. Modify (Append) File**

Adds new content to the existing file without deleting the original text.

These operations help understand how Java interacts with the file system using classes like:

* `FileWriter`
* `FileReader`
* `BufferedReader`
* `IOException`

## **Technologies Used**

* **Java (JDK 8 or above)**
* **VS Code** with Java extensions
* Standard Java I/O libraries

---

## **Features**

* Create new text files
* Overwrite existing content
* Append additional text
* Read file content
* Error handling with try–catch blocks
* Beginner-friendly code structure
